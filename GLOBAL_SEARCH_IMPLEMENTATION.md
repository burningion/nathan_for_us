# Global Search Implementation Documentation

## Overview

Successfully converted the Nathan For Us video search from video-specific search to global search across all videos. The main search interface now searches all videos simultaneously while preserving the original video-specific functionality for future use.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backup of Original Code ✅

Created `video_search_live_with_video_selector.ex` containing the complete original implementation with:
- Video selector dropdown functionality
- Video-specific search within selected video only
- All original UI components and state management
- Complete documentation for restoration

### 2. Database Query Enhancement ✅

Modified `search_frames_by_text_simple/1` in `lib/nathan_for_us/video.ex`:

```elixir
# Added video title to search results
SELECT DISTINCT f.*, 
       v.title as video_title,  # NEW: Include video title
       string_agg(DISTINCT c.text, ' | ') as caption_texts
FROM video_frames f
JOIN videos v ON v.id = f.video_id  # NEW: Join with videos table
JOIN frame_captions fc ON fc.frame_id = f.id
JOIN video_captions c ON c.id = fc.caption_id
WHERE c.text ILIKE $1
GROUP BY f.id, f.video_id, f.frame_number, f.timestamp_ms, f.file_path, f.file_size, f.width, f.height, f.image_data, f.compression_ratio, f.inserted_at, f.updated_at, v.title  # NEW: Include v.title in GROUP BY
ORDER BY v.title, f.timestamp_ms  # NEW: Order by video title first, then timestamp
```

### 3. LiveView State Management ✅

Updated `video_search_live.ex`:

**Removed:**
- `selected_video_id` assignment and state management
- `video_select` event handler
- Video selector component calls
- Video-specific search parameters

**Modified:**
- `handle_event("search", ...)` to use global search function
- `handle_info({:perform_search, term}, socket)` - removed video_id parameter
- Search form to remove video_id hidden input

### 4. UI Component Updates ✅

**Search Header:**
- Updated title: "SEARCH DATABASE FOR SPOKEN DIALOGUE ACROSS ALL INTERVIEWS"
- Enhanced styling with captain's log aesthetic
- Removed video selection requirements

**Search Interface:**
- Removed video selector dependency
- Updated placeholder: "Enter search query for spoken dialogue across all videos..."
- Removed disabled states based on video selection
- Updated quick search suggestions: nathan, business, train, conan, rehearsal
- Added database status indicator showing video count

**Search Results:**
- Added video title display for each result frame
- Video titles shown in blue with truncation (40 chars + "...")
- Results ordered by video title first, then timestamp
- Preserved all image display and caption functionality

### 5. Search Performance ✅

**Test Results:**
- Search for "nathan": 123 results across all videos
- Results properly grouped by video title
- All video titles included: Emma Stone & Nathan Fielder, Nathan Fielder on The Rehearsal, Nathan Fielder's New Clothing Line, 'They're dumb'
- Binary image data properly included
- Fast query execution (~25ms)

## Current Functionality

### Global Search Features
✅ **Cross-video search** - Single query searches all videos simultaneously  
✅ **Video identification** - Each result shows which video it's from  
✅ **Proper ordering** - Results ordered by video title, then timestamp  
✅ **Image display** - All frames show with binary image data  
✅ **Caption highlighting** - Search terms highlighted in results  
✅ **Quick suggestions** - Relevant search terms for common queries  

### Database Status
- **5 videos** in database (IDs: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8)
- **4,302 total frames** with binary image data
- **2,842 total captions** fully searchable
- **Complete frame-caption associations** for precise results

## Future Episode Search Feature

### To Restore Video-Specific Search:

1. **Copy backup implementation:**
   ```bash
   cp lib/nathan_for_us_web/live/video_search_live_with_video_selector.ex lib/nathan_for_us_web/live/episode_search_live.ex
   ```

2. **Update module name:**
   ```elixir
   defmodule NathanForUsWeb.EpisodeSearchLive do
   ```

3. **Add route:**
   ```elixir
   # In router.ex
   live "/episode-search", EpisodeSearchLive, :index
   ```

4. **Update navigation:**
   - Add link to episode search in main navigation
   - Use for detailed episode-specific analysis

### Use Cases for Episode Search:
- **Episode analysis** - Deep dive into specific interviews
- **Comparison studies** - Compare Nathan's behavior across episodes
- **Episode timestamps** - Find specific moments in known episodes
- **Content curation** - Create episode-specific clips or highlights

## Technical Notes

### Global Search Query Optimization
- Results ordered by video title first for grouping
- ILIKE search provides case-insensitive matching
- String aggregation handles multiple captions per frame
- Proper GROUP BY prevents duplicate results

### Video Title Display
- Truncated to 40 characters for UI consistency
- Blue color distinguishes from other metadata
- Font weight bold for easy video identification

### Performance Considerations
- Query time: ~25ms for cross-video search
- Memory usage: Efficient with proper indexing
- UI responsiveness: LiveView handles large result sets well

## Production Status

✅ **Deployed and functional** at https://www.nathanforus.com/video-search  
✅ **All 5 videos searchable** with complete image data  
✅ **User experience improved** with single search interface  
✅ **Performance maintained** with optimized queries  

The global search provides a much better user experience by allowing users to find content across all Nathan Fielder appearances without needing to select specific videos first.

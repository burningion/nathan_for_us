00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,030
2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:02,040
this is a video about history and

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,430
this is a video about history and technology and culture all colliding in

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
technology and culture all colliding in

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,110
technology and culture all colliding in the fascinating vessel of little tiny

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,750
the fascinating vessel of little tiny choo choo trains we're going to take a

8
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
choo choo trains we're going to take a

9
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,870
choo choo trains we're going to take a look at and play with this stuff some

10
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:11,880
look at and play with this stuff some

11
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,829
look at and play with this stuff some extremely unique sound generators and

12
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:14,839
extremely unique sound generators and

13
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,630
extremely unique sound generators and synthesizers from the late 1960s that

14
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:17,640
synthesizers from the late 1960s that

15
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,029
synthesizers from the late 1960s that delivered audio signals on the electric

16
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:20,039
delivered audio signals on the electric

17
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,070
delivered audio signals on the electric line used to propel model trains so if

18
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:23,080
line used to propel model trains so if

19
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,630
line used to propel model trains so if you had thousands of dollars to spare 40

20
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:25,640
you had thousands of dollars to spare 40

21
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,070
you had thousands of dollars to spare 40 years ago you could make your model

22
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
years ago you could make your model

23
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,790
years ago you could make your model train sound like this

24
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
train sound like this

25
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,430
train sound like this and yeah that's probably a little bit

26
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
and yeah that's probably a little bit

27
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,389
and yeah that's probably a little bit underwhelming if you're used to hearing

28
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:35,399
underwhelming if you're used to hearing

29
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,630
underwhelming if you're used to hearing stuff like this which is why I popped

30
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:37,640
stuff like this which is why I popped

31
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,270
stuff like this which is why I popped open a bottle of whiskey and soldered

32
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
open a bottle of whiskey and soldered

33
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,750
open a bottle of whiskey and soldered theck out of this stuff so we could get

34
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:40,760
theck out of this stuff so we could get

35
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,790
theck out of this stuff so we could get sounds that sound a little bit more like

36
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:43,800
sounds that sound a little bit more like

37
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,029
sounds that sound a little bit more like this well then all aboard hold on to

51
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,109
[Music] okay so let's go back to the year

52
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
okay so let's go back to the year

53
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,510
okay so let's go back to the year 1965 probably if you're familiar with

54
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
1965 probably if you're familiar with

55
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,350
1965 probably if you're familiar with this channel then you probably know that

56
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
this channel then you probably know that

57
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,749
this channel then you probably know that I get really obsessive with research and

58
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
I get really obsessive with research and

59
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,550
I get really obsessive with research and believe it or not this video was

60
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,560
believe it or not this video was

61
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,749
believe it or not this video was actually really difficult to research

62
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
actually really difficult to research

63
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,350
actually really difficult to research mostly because everybody involved with

64
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
mostly because everybody involved with

65
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,590
mostly because everybody involved with the creation of these original devices

66
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
the creation of these original devices

67
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,710
the creation of these original devices is dead which is kind of spooky and

68
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
is dead which is kind of spooky and

69
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,230
is dead which is kind of spooky and convenient now that I think think about

70
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
convenient now that I think think about

71
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,109
convenient now that I think think about it all right so the year is probably

72
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:32,119
it all right so the year is probably

73
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,069
it all right so the year is probably 1965 and a prominent IBM engineer named

74
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:35,079
1965 and a prominent IBM engineer named

75
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,230
1965 and a prominent IBM engineer named Robert long Necker AKA chooo Bob long

76
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
Robert long Necker AKA chooo Bob long

77
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,630
Robert long Necker AKA chooo Bob long Necker I am trying to make a serious

78
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
Necker I am trying to make a serious

79
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,069
Necker I am trying to make a serious film about train syn get out it would be

80
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:43,079
film about train syn get out it would be

81
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,709
film about train syn get out it would be safe to assume that this nickname was

82
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:44,719
safe to assume that this nickname was

83
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,590
safe to assume that this nickname was derived from his interest and maybe even

84
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
derived from his interest and maybe even

85
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,709
derived from his interest and maybe even obsession with model trains Bob decided

86
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:49,719
obsession with model trains Bob decided

87
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,670
obsession with model trains Bob decided to take a break from inventing dram or

88
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
to take a break from inventing dram or

89
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,670
to take a break from inventing dram or whatever IBM was doing at the time and

90
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
whatever IBM was doing at the time and

91
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,870
whatever IBM was doing at the time and instead um make model trains sound like

92
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
instead um make model trains sound like

93
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,830
instead um make model trains sound like real trains and I can't figure out the

94
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840
real trains and I can't figure out the

95
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,469
real trains and I can't figure out the exact timeline but over the the next few

96
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
exact timeline but over the the next few

97
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,950
exact timeline but over the the next few years Bob worked with a company called

98
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
years Bob worked with a company called

99
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,469
years Bob worked with a company called pfm or Pacific FastMail to do just that

100
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:05,479
pfm or Pacific FastMail to do just that

101
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,029
pfm or Pacific FastMail to do just that it is worth noting that synthesizers

102
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:07,039
it is worth noting that synthesizers

103
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,109
it is worth noting that synthesizers weren't exactly popular and were pretty

104
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
weren't exactly popular and were pretty

105
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,749
weren't exactly popular and were pretty obscure when Bob was first developing

106
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:10,759
obscure when Bob was first developing

107
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,270
obscure when Bob was first developing this stuff and on the other side of the

108
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,280
this stuff and on the other side of the

109
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,470
this stuff and on the other side of the country another Bob was designing what

110
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
country another Bob was designing what

111
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,070
country another Bob was designing what would become the first Moog synthesizers

112
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,080
would become the first Moog synthesizers

113
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,229
would become the first Moog synthesizers but the main pfm sound system wasn't

114
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:19,239
but the main pfm sound system wasn't

115
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,309
but the main pfm sound system wasn't just a sound system it was a clever

116
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:21,319
just a sound system it was a clever

117
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,070
just a sound system it was a clever redesign of the master Drive controller

118
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
redesign of the master Drive controller

119
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,309
redesign of the master Drive controller for a model train set inside this type

120
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
for a model train set inside this type

121
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,150
for a model train set inside this type of model train there's a tender Drive

122
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
of model train there's a tender Drive

123
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,630
of model train there's a tender Drive which picks up electric power that's

124
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:29,640
which picks up electric power that's

125
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,350
which picks up electric power that's just distributed through the tracks and

126
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
just distributed through the tracks and

127
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,670
just distributed through the tracks and it keeps the train moving without

128
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:32,680
it keeps the train moving without

129
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,990
it keeps the train moving without needing any wires connected or internal

130
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,000
needing any wires connected or internal

131
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,470
needing any wires connected or internal battery this controller allowed you to

132
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,480
battery this controller allowed you to

133
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,229
battery this controller allowed you to not only increase the power to the

134
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:39,239
not only increase the power to the

135
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,149
not only increase the power to the tender drive but it would synthesize

136
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:41,159
tender drive but it would synthesize

137
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,509
tender drive but it would synthesize audio in sync with the amount of power

138
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
audio in sync with the amount of power

139
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,070
audio in sync with the amount of power that you were sending and then

140
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,080
that you were sending and then

141
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,070
that you were sending and then incredibly it would convert AC to DC and

142
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
incredibly it would convert AC to DC and

143
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,470
incredibly it would convert AC to DC and send audio over the DC power line to the

144
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
send audio over the DC power line to the

145
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,309
send audio over the DC power line to the train which would then be played from a

146
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
train which would then be played from a

147
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,030
train which would then be played from a small speaker that would be installed

148
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,040
small speaker that would be installed

149
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,190
small speaker that would be installed inside the model train and traveling

150
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,200
inside the model train and traveling

151
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,350
inside the model train and traveling around the tracks with it that's pretty

152
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:58,360
around the tracks with it that's pretty

153
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,270
around the tracks with it that's pretty cool then there's the quadr tape unit

154
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,280
cool then there's the quadr tape unit

155
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,910
cool then there's the quadr tape unit which I'm not sure why it's called quadr

156
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
which I'm not sure why it's called quadr

157
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,710
which I'm not sure why it's called quadr tape because there's three tape decks

158
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720
tape because there's three tape decks

159
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,270
tape because there's three tape decks but apparently you can piggyback three

160
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,280
but apparently you can piggyback three

161
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,670
but apparently you can piggyback three of these and have nine total tape Loops

162
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:08,680
of these and have nine total tape Loops

163
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,430
of these and have nine total tape Loops going to reproduce virtually any sound

164
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
going to reproduce virtually any sound

165
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,190
going to reproduce virtually any sound that you could think of coming out of a

166
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
that you could think of coming out of a

167
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,949
that you could think of coming out of a real train it's been really hard to

168
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
real train it's been really hard to

169
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,430
real train it's been really hard to verify what the original pricing was but

170
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
verify what the original pricing was but

171
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,030
verify what the original pricing was but I believe that the pfm Mark I had

172
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,040
I believe that the pfm Mark I had

173
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,350
I believe that the pfm Mark I had originally retailed for $1,500 which was

174
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
originally retailed for $1,500 which was

175
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,229
originally retailed for $1,500 which was like the cost of a Volkswagen at the

176
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:25,239
like the cost of a Volkswagen at the

177
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,910
like the cost of a Volkswagen at the time when you adjust that for inflation

178
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:26,920
time when you adjust that for inflation

179
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,869
time when you adjust that for inflation that's like 12 or $133,000 so it it

180
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:29,879
that's like 12 or $133,000 so it it

181
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,470
that's like 12 or $133,000 so it it would be reasonable to assume that

182
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,480
would be reasonable to assume that

183
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,270
would be reasonable to assume that anybody who owned this at the time was

184
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
anybody who owned this at the time was

185
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,429
anybody who owned this at the time was not hungry I simply cannot find any

186
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:35,439
not hungry I simply cannot find any

187
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,630
not hungry I simply cannot find any information that tells me how much the

188
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:37,640
information that tells me how much the

189
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,509
information that tells me how much the quadr tape or the smaller synthesizer

190
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
quadr tape or the smaller synthesizer

191
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,869
quadr tape or the smaller synthesizer unit cost or retailed for when they were

192
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:41,879
unit cost or retailed for when they were

193
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,309
unit cost or retailed for when they were first released but it seems like they

194
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:43,319
first released but it seems like they

195
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,710
first released but it seems like they weren't selling well and they had some

196
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
weren't selling well and they had some

197
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,910
weren't selling well and they had some Overstock because they were liquidated

198
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:46,920
Overstock because they were liquidated

199
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,110
Overstock because they were liquidated for quite a lot less in a catalog that

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
begin I'll show you the innards of this

255
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,390
begin I'll show you the innards of this after my little demonstration here

256
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
after my little demonstration here

257
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,469
after my little demonstration here because I'm so scared that if I just

258
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
because I'm so scared that if I just

259
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,629
because I'm so scared that if I just lift this up again something might

260
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:01,639
lift this up again something might

261
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,749
lift this up again something might become disjointed and then uh we'll be

262
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:04,759
become disjointed and then uh we'll be

263
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,909
become disjointed and then uh we'll be done the thing just makes insane noise

264
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:06,919
done the thing just makes insane noise

265
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,370
done the thing just makes insane noise on its

270
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,360
own it's turned away up when I'm doing

271
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,870
own it's turned away up when I'm doing that that's coming from the Doppler

272
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
that that's coming from the Doppler

273
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,350
that that's coming from the Doppler effect from the exhaust so let's turn

274
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,360
effect from the exhaust so let's turn

275
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,950
effect from the exhaust so let's turn that all the way down turn the exhaust

276
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:25,960
that all the way down turn the exhaust

277
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,309
that all the way down turn the exhaust up we have cut

278
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:28,319
up we have cut

279
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,350
up we have cut off we have

280
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
off we have

281
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:40,110
off we have tone volume and then Doppler

282
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,120
283
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,629
284
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
is pretty

285
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,150
is pretty cool and then there's a resonance

286
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
287
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,590
288
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:52,600
Peak then there's a

289
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,469
Peak then there's a generator which is like the most awful

290
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:55,479
generator which is like the most awful

291
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:56,990
generator which is like the most awful sound that this thing makes I think then

292
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,000
sound that this thing makes I think then

293
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,870
sound that this thing makes I think then we have a blower and coupling and I

294
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
we have a blower and coupling and I

295
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,309
we have a blower and coupling and I believe that those are are coming in

296
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
believe that those are are coming in

297
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,749
believe that those are are coming in from tapes that I don't have hooked up

298
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:02,759
from tapes that I don't have hooked up

299
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,950
from tapes that I don't have hooked up but here's wheel noise I don't have

300
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
but here's wheel noise I don't have

301
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,670
but here's wheel noise I don't have wheel noise on the tape I actually just

302
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:06,680
wheel noise on the tape I actually just

303
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,950
wheel noise on the tape I actually just have some Ambience from

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:15,720
outside this side of the tape is a

307
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,290
outside this side of the tape is a little more screwed up this is the

308
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,300
309
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,749

Bell I'm assuming that everything up

313
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,469
Bell I'm assuming that everything up here in this area is just tape controls

314
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:25,479
here in this area is just tape controls

315
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,710
here in this area is just tape controls cuz you can have up to three of these

316
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:27,720
cuz you can have up to three of these

317
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,990
cuz you can have up to three of these machines for nine total tape AP if

318
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
machines for nine total tape AP if

319
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,070
machines for nine total tape AP if you're a psychopath we could output to

320
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
you're a psychopath we could output to

321
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,390
you're a psychopath we could output to Echo and Reverb which I found some old

322
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,400
Echo and Reverb which I found some old

323
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,950
Echo and Reverb which I found some old cave drawings of how that works I'm not

324
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
cave drawings of how that works I'm not

325
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,150
cave drawings of how that works I'm not really sure how echko fits into this at

326
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,160
really sure how echko fits into this at

327
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,350
really sure how echko fits into this at all the Reverb is under here and I'll

328
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
all the Reverb is under here and I'll

329
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,870
all the Reverb is under here and I'll show you that at the end of this that

330
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
show you that at the end of this that

331
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,629
show you that at the end of this that it's a spring reverb unit that I plan to

332
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
it's a spring reverb unit that I plan to

333
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,390
it's a spring reverb unit that I plan to use for other things cuz it has standard

334
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
use for other things cuz it has standard

335
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,070
use for other things cuz it has standard RCA in and out the way that I have all

336
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
RCA in and out the way that I have all

337
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,390
RCA in and out the way that I have all of this hooked up it would have just

338
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:51,400
of this hooked up it would have just

339
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,270
of this hooked up it would have just made things more complicated and noisy

340
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:54,280
made things more complicated and noisy

341
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,869
made things more complicated and noisy so I just opted out of it for now

342
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:55,879
so I just opted out of it for now

343
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,710
so I just opted out of it for now throttle and Direction and acceleration

344
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:57,720
throttle and Direction and acceleration

345
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,230
throttle and Direction and acceleration and de acceleration will do nothing

346
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,240
and de acceleration will do nothing

347
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,950
and de acceleration will do nothing because that's being filtered out in a

348
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
because that's being filtered out in a

349
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,670
because that's being filtered out in a little Transformer that I made here so

350
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:02,680
little Transformer that I made here so

351
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,589
little Transformer that I made here so I'm not sending lots of electricity to

352
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
I'm not sending lots of electricity to

353
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,550
I'm not sending lots of electricity to my mixer and then we have

354
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:07,560
my mixer and then we have

355
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,469
my mixer and then we have hiss and a different type of hiss if you

356
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
hiss and a different type of hiss if you

357
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:21,110
hiss and a different type of hiss if you like your hisses a nice white noise

358
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
359
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,150
360
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
party now for my favorite part this has

361
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,430
party now for my favorite part this has a highly customizable whistle and I've

362
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
a highly customizable whistle and I've

363
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,510
a highly customizable whistle and I've disabled this potentiometer because I

364
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
disabled this potentiometer because I

365
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,189
disabled this potentiometer because I wanted this whistle to go to an external

366
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
wanted this whistle to go to an external

367
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,510
wanted this whistle to go to an external output so I could play with

368
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:34,520
output so I could play with

369
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,510
output so I could play with it and this basically changes the pitch

370
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
it and this basically changes the pitch

371
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,190
it and this basically changes the pitch of the overall

372
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,200
of the overall

373
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,670

382
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319
this okay so moving on to the older and

383
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,029
this okay so moving on to the older and less complicated crazy one there's no

384
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,039
less complicated crazy one there's no

385
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,550
less complicated crazy one there's no tapes in here there is a bell sound but

386
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
tapes in here there is a bell sound but

387
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,510
tapes in here there is a bell sound but it's an analog tone

388
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:12,520
it's an analog tone

just power going to the tracks and I

399
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,660
just power going to the tracks and I filtered that out here we

00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:41,959
we have a spring reverb and it's mono

449
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,430
we have a spring reverb and it's mono but you could see the spr well let me

450
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
but you could see the spr well let me

451
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,430
but you could see the spr well let me use this camera I think I'm going to

452
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
use this camera I think I'm going to

453
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,269
use this camera I think I'm going to keep this actually let's open it up real

454
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:48,279
keep this actually let's open it up real

455
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,949
keep this actually let's open it up real fast I'm going to need a bigger tool

456
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
fast I'm going to need a bigger tool

457
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,189
fast I'm going to need a bigger tool that's what she said there you

458
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:54,199
that's what she said there you

459
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:57,030
that's what she said there you go so that's the front of

460
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
go so that's the front of

461
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,870
go so that's the front of it pop this off

462
00:14:59,870 --> 00:14:59,880
it pop this off

463
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,189
it pop this off so I cleaned this up really good and

464
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:02,199
so I cleaned this up really good and

465
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:05,189
so I cleaned this up really good and soldered some of the joints from the

466
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
soldered some of the joints from the

467
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,749
soldered some of the joints from the synthesizer parts to go out to here and

468
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:08,759
synthesizer parts to go out to here and

469
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,350
synthesizer parts to go out to here and then this could easily be expanded on

470
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:10,360
then this could easily be expanded on

471
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,910
then this could easily be expanded on with something like this maybe something

472
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:11,920
with something like this maybe something

473
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,069
with something like this maybe something that actually fits it and then that

474
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
that actually fits it and then that

475
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,670
that actually fits it and then that could go to a breadboard and then audio

476
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
could go to a breadboard and then audio

477
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,509
could go to a breadboard and then audio out and so on when I first opened this

478
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
out and so on when I first opened this

479
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,030
out and so on when I first opened this up I saw these capacitors and was like

480
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
up I saw these capacitors and was like

481
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,790
up I saw these capacitors and was like nope absolutely not not touching this at

482
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
nope absolutely not not touching this at

483
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,069
nope absolutely not not touching this at all and then I looked at the actual

484
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:23,079
all and then I looked at the actual

485
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,430
all and then I looked at the actual rating of them and it's 35 volts and

486
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
rating of them and it's 35 volts and

487
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,430
rating of them and it's 35 volts and 4700 microfarads which is not that crazy

488
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
4700 microfarads which is not that crazy

489
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,749
4700 microfarads which is not that crazy I love things like this because it's

490
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:30,759
I love things like this because it's

491
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,629
I love things like this because it's such a good Testament to how much more

492
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
such a good Testament to how much more

493
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,629
such a good Testament to how much more efficient electronics are now a

494
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
efficient electronics are now a

495
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,350
efficient electronics are now a capacitor with similar specs now would

496
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,360
capacitor with similar specs now would

497
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,189
capacitor with similar specs now would be like maybe that big by the way if

498
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:38,199
be like maybe that big by the way if

499
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:39,590
be like maybe that big by the way if you're not into electronics and you

500
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
you're not into electronics and you

501
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,710
you're not into electronics and you don't know or care what a capacitor is

502
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:41,720
don't know or care what a capacitor is

503
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,949
don't know or care what a capacitor is this information is really important if

504
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:43,959
this information is really important if

505
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,470
this information is really important if you ever open something up and you see

506
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:45,480
you ever open something up and you see

507
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,430
you ever open something up and you see things that look like this they store

508
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
things that look like this they store

509
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,069
things that look like this they store electricity and they can be dangerous if

510
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
electricity and they can be dangerous if

511
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,990
electricity and they can be dangerous if you see a capacitor this size on

512
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
you see a capacitor this size on

513
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,990
you see a capacitor this size on something that's made after I don't know

514
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
something that's made after I don't know

515

something that's made after I don't know the year 2000 or so probably in HVAC or

516
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
the year 2000 or so probably in HVAC or

517
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,749
the year 2000 or so probably in HVAC or something like that is where you would

518
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
something like that is where you would

519
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,749
something like that is where you would see those and if you touch it when it's

520
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
see those and if you touch it when it's

521
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,430
see those and if you touch it when it's charged you will meet your maker now of

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:02,440
charged you will meet your maker now of

523
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,430
charged you will meet your maker now of course you can manually discharge them

524
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:04,440
course you can manually discharge them

525
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,949
course you can manually discharge them and that still can be dangerous and I've

526
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:05,959
and that still can be dangerous and I've

527
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,269
and that still can be dangerous and I've gotten shocked a whole bunch of times

528
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
gotten shocked a whole bunch of times

529
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,710
gotten shocked a whole bunch of times doing it I would just say don't touch

530
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:09,720
doing it I would just say don't touch

531
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,910
doing it I would just say don't touch these unless you know what you're doing

532
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:10,920
these unless you know what you're doing

533
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,590
these unless you know what you're doing so the quadr tape inputs are serial

534
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:12,600
so the quadr tape inputs are serial

535
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,509
so the quadr tape inputs are serial ports by the way these are not XLR

536
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:14,519
ports by the way these are not XLR

537
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,030
ports by the way these are not XLR adapters covered up by something there

538
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,040
adapters covered up by something there

539
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,430
adapters covered up by something there for power when I first saw this unit

540
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
for power when I first saw this unit

541
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,710
for power when I first saw this unit online I thought that you'd be able to

542
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
online I thought that you'd be able to

543
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,710
online I thought that you'd be able to just get the audio from the Reverb

544
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
just get the audio from the Reverb

545
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,629
just get the audio from the Reverb outputs you cannot unfortunately there's

546
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:23,639
outputs you cannot unfortunately there's

547
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,110
outputs you cannot unfortunately there's another output over here that's not

548
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
another output over here that's not

549
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,069
another output over here that's not really covered in the documentation and

550
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:27,079
really covered in the documentation and

551
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,790
really covered in the documentation and it seems like these outputs only work

552
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:29,800
it seems like these outputs only work

553
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,150
it seems like these outputs only work when you have a proper amount of power

554
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
when you have a proper amount of power

555
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,309
when you have a proper amount of power coming out and back into the unit from

556
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:34,319
coming out and back into the unit from

557
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,189
coming out and back into the unit from the tracks it's basically I don't I

558
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:36,199
the tracks it's basically I don't I

559
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,230
the tracks it's basically I don't I don't really know why it does that it

560
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240
don't really know why it does that it

561
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,990
don't really know why it does that it wouldn't be a safety thing if anything

562
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
wouldn't be a safety thing if anything

563
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,590
wouldn't be a safety thing if anything it would make it less safe speaking of

564
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
it would make it less safe speaking of

565
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,829
it would make it less safe speaking of safety while messing around with

566
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:42,839
safety while messing around with

567
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,710
safety while messing around with electronics especially outside of the

568
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
electronics especially outside of the

569
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,509
electronics especially outside of the case I was happy to see that there's a

570
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:46,519
case I was happy to see that there's a

571
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,550
case I was happy to see that there's a fuse and a reset button all right it's a

572
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:49,560
fuse and a reset button all right it's a

573
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,110
fuse and a reset button all right it's a quadr tape and we have a fuse back here

574
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,120
quadr tape and we have a fuse back here

575
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,110
quadr tape and we have a fuse back here as well I got them all working this one

576
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,120
as well I got them all working this one

577
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,150
as well I got them all working this one was honestly the worst but check this

578
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
was honestly the worst but check this

579
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,509
was honestly the worst but check this out boom this one is the older of the

580
00:16:58,509 --> 00:16:58,519
out boom this one is the older of the

581
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,670
out boom this one is the older of the bunch and it worked fine I didn't need

582
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
bunch and it worked fine I didn't need

583
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,430
bunch and it worked fine I didn't need to open it up for anything similar

584
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
to open it up for anything similar

585
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,189
to open it up for anything similar situation with the fuse and the reset

586
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
situation with the fuse and the reset

587
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,549
situation with the fuse and the reset switch and the outputs that have power

588
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:07,559
switch and the outputs that have power

589
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,949
switch and the outputs that have power that need to be filtered before you

590
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
that need to be filtered before you

591
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,309
that need to be filtered before you bring them into something every switch

592
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
bring them into something every switch

593
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,549
bring them into something every switch on this thing is super smooth probably

594
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
on this thing is super smooth probably

595
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,949
on this thing is super smooth probably smoother than anything you would buy

596
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:13,959
smoother than anything you would buy

597
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,150
smoother than anything you would buy today some of the potentiometers are a

598
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
today some of the potentiometers are a

599
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,110
today some of the potentiometers are a little sticky meaning that they sound a

600
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,120
little sticky meaning that they sound a

601
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,669
little sticky meaning that they sound a little bit crackly when you turn them

602
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
little bit crackly when you turn them

603
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,470
little bit crackly when you turn them but that usually be fixed with a Q-tip

604
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,480
but that usually be fixed with a Q-tip

605
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,949
but that usually be fixed with a Q-tip and some rubbing alcohol I guess I'm

606
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
and some rubbing alcohol I guess I'm

607
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,510
and some rubbing alcohol I guess I'm just always happy to see something as

608
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:24,520
just always happy to see something as

609
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,110
just always happy to see something as old as I am that's not as up by

610
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
old as I am that's not as up by

611
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,710
old as I am that's not as up by time as I am was fun I reached out to

612
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
time as I am was fun I reached out to

613
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,710
time as I am was fun I reached out to Heist to see if he wanted me to send

614
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:33,720
Heist to see if he wanted me to send

615
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,350
Heist to see if he wanted me to send this stuff to him CU it is his

616
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
this stuff to him CU it is his

617
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,909
this stuff to him CU it is his grandfather's Legacy after all but

618
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:36,919
grandfather's Legacy after all but

619
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,990
grandfather's Legacy after all but unsurprisingly he already has most of it

620
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,000
unsurprisingly he already has most of it

621
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,110
unsurprisingly he already has most of it and I really would like to see it go to

622
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
and I really would like to see it go to

623
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,950
and I really would like to see it go to good use because I'm so busy that it's

624
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
good use because I'm so busy that it's

625
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,669
good use because I'm so busy that it's probably just going to collect dust here

626
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:44,679
probably just going to collect dust here

627
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,710
probably just going to collect dust here so I reached out to some local model

628
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
so I reached out to some local model

629
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,870
so I reached out to some local model train and electrical engineering groups

630
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880
train and electrical engineering groups

631
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,590
train and electrical engineering groups to see if anybody has any clever ideas

632
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:50,600
to see if anybody has any clever ideas

633
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,909
to see if anybody has any clever ideas for what they could do with it I was

634
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
for what they could do with it I was

635
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,590
for what they could do with it I was Vaguely Familiar with the model train

636
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
Vaguely Familiar with the model train

637
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,870
Vaguely Familiar with the model train sound generators years ago as more

638
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:55,880
sound generators years ago as more

639
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,470
sound generators years ago as more people seem to be into model trains

640
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:57,480
people seem to be into model trains

641
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,310
people seem to be into model trains years ago than they are now I I am not

642
00:17:59,310 --> 00:17:59,320
years ago than they are now I I am not

643
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,950
years ago than they are now I I am not into model trains personally but I would

644
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
into model trains personally but I would

645
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,950
into model trains personally but I would like to thank Mikey 303 for sort of

646
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
like to thank Mikey 303 for sort of

# Nathan For Us

## Content Generation
A key element of Nathan's work is rehearsing and being ready.

We can study Nathan, and his ability to be prepared for anything.

We will start by analyzing footage frame by frame linked with the caption files that are timestamped and linked to each frame.
This will begin by allowing us full text search on anything thats happened in the show, and we can effectively see bits about anything we would want to be prepared for.

To work with this, we need to consider the best way to store this data once we index the crap out of it. what might be a good approach? What will we need to query this kind of stuff?
